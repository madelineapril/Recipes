This curry chicken recipe is my family's favorite. It's a classic yellow curry made with chunks of chicken and potatoes, and tastes like one of those wonderful curry dishes you can find in the marketplaces and streets of Bangkok. The use of curry powder helps the dish come together quickly and easily. If you can, make your own using my recipe, OR look for a good Madras curry powder at your local Asian or Indian food store - a Madras blend works well with Thai flavors, and will give you far better results than your average supermarket curry powder. ENJOY!

**Total Time:** 1 hour, 20 minutes

**Yield:** SERVES 4+

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 lb chicken breast or thigh, chopped into small chunks, OR whole chicken pieces
* 2-3 potatoes, chopped into chunks
* optional: 1-2 medium tomatoes, chopped into chunks
* 1/4 cup fresh coriander for garnish
* 2 Tbsp. Thai curry powder , OR 3 Tbsp. Madras curry powder or regular curry powder
* 1 bay leaf
* optional: 1 cinnamon stick
* 1/2 to 1 tsp. chili flakes or cayenne pepper, to taste
* 2 shallots OR 1/2 cup purple onion, diced
* 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 thumb-size piece galangal OR ginger, grated
* 1/2 cup chicken stock or broth
* 1+1/2 Tbsp. ketchup OR sweet tomato puree
* 1 can thick coconut milk
* 2-3 Tbsp. fish sauce
* optional: 1/2 tsp. sugar
* 2-3 Tbsp. vegetable oil for stir-frying
* Optional: 1-2 whole kaffir lime leaves (available at Asian food stores)

Preparation
-----------

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees (if using oven method).
2. Place a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the curry powder, bay leaf, cinnamon stick (if using) and chili/cayenne. "Dry fry" these spices 1-2 minutes, until they are lightly toasted and fragrant.
3. Add 2 Tbsp. oil, plus the shallots, garlic, and galangal or ginger. Also add a few Tbsp. of the chicken stock - enough to keep ingredient frying nicely. Stir-fry 1 minute.
4. Add the chicken and potatoes, stir-frying 1 minute to coat with the spices.
5. Add remaining stock plus ketchup/tomato puree, stirring well to combine.
6. Add the coconut milk, fish sauce, sugar, and kaffir lime leaves (if using).
7. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to simmer for 30 minutes or until cooked. OR transfer curry to a large covered casserole dish and bake 1 hour at 350 degrees. Add tomatoes during the last 10 to 15 minutes of cooking (not before, or they will keep potatoes from becoming tender).
8. When chicken is cooked and tender, taste-test the curry for saltiness and flavor, adding more fish sauce as needed until desired flavor/salt level is achieved. Also add more cayenne, chili sauce, or fresh-cut chilies if you prefer it spicier. If too spicy, add more coconut milk or a little plain yogurt. Add a little more sugar if it's too sour for your taste.
9. Sprinkle over the fresh coriander, serve with plenty of jasmine-scented rice, and ENJOY!

*Note About Fish Sauce in this Recipe:* My apologies to one of the reviewers of this recipe who found 4 Tbsp. fish sauce too salty. This may be because the curry powder you used already contained salt in it.

When I was in Thailand, I watched as Thai chefs poured 1/4 cup or more of fish sauce into their curries. I now prefer my curry this way too (a little on the salty side). If you prefer less salt, I suggest starting with 2 Tbsp. fish sauce and adding more to taste later, once the curry is fully cooked.
